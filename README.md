Chapter 2: The Importance of Artificial Intelligence
2.1 What is meant by “importance of AI”
The importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) lies in how it is becoming a core driver of modern economic and social change. AI enables predictive insights, automation, and new forms of knowledge creation across many sectors, which is why its capabilities and adoption are accelerating globally. 
2.2 AI and productivity
One of the strongest arguments for AI’s value is productivity. Evidence highlighted in major global tracking reports suggests AI tools can help people complete tasks faster and improve the quality of outputs, and in some contexts may narrow performance gaps between more and less experienced workers. However, these gains are not automatic. Poorly governed or poorly integrated AI can reduce performance, so training, system design, and oversight matter . 
2.3 AI as a strategic and economic advantage
AI is also important because it is shaping competitive strategy. Organisations are investing faster partly due to the expected economic returns from generative AI in areas such as customer support, marketing, software development, and analytics. This positions AI not just as a tool, but as a capability linked to long-term organisational advantage . 
2.4 AI, jobs, and future skills
AI’s influence on labour markets makes it socially and economically significant. Forecasts for 2025-2030 indicate that some roles will be automated while new roles will emerge, especially for AI and data specialists. This shift raises the importance of AI literacy alongside distinctly human capabilities such as judgment, communication, and ethical decision-making . 
2.5 AI for development and inclusion
AI is increasingly framed as a tool for development goals, including improved public services and better decision-making in sectors like health, agriculture, and social support. At the same time, there is a real risk of widening inequality if AI systems are designed without local context, infrastructure, data, and skills in mind. Inclusive adoption strategies are therefore essential . 
2.6 Ethics and governance
As AI becomes embedded in high-impact decisions, ethical and regulatory guidance is no longer optional . International principles emphasise human rights, dignity, transparency, fairness, and meaningful human oversight. Practical frameworks also help organisations identify and manage AI risks across the system lifecycle. These safeguards shape whether AI delivers broad benefits or amplifies existing harms .

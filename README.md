Chapter 2: The Importance of Artificial Intelligence
Modern economic and social transformation depends heavily on Artificial Intelligence (AI) as its primary driving force. The technology enables wide-ranging sectoral support through its predictive capabilities and automated processes and knowledge creation functions. The Stanford AI Index shows AI capabilities and usage are advancing at a fast pace because organizations now use AI for operational and decision-making purposes . 
The importance of AI stems from its ability to enhance productivity and performance levels. The AI Index demonstrates that AI tools enable workers to finish their work more quickly while producing better results and sometimes they reduce the difference between skilled and unskilled workers. The implementation of AI tools does not guarantee performance improvement. The implementation of AI tools without proper oversight will decrease operational performance. Organizations need to design their systems and train their staff and establish governance structures to achieve responsible AI value extraction.
AI serves as a fundamental element for organizations to develop their competitive strategies and generate economic value. The projected economic benefits of generative AI technology will generate substantial returns for businesses through its application in knowledge-based operations including customer support and marketing and software development and operations analytics. The projected economic benefits drive organizations to speed up their investments and testing activities .
AI transforms the job market through its impact on future work requirements and skill demands. The World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2025 shows that employers predict AI will transform their workforce planning during 2025-2030 by creating new positions for AI experts while eliminating roles that can be automated. The adoption of AI technology will make AI literacy and data competence and human abilities such as judgment and communication essential for basic job requirements .
The development community views AI as having two distinct impacts on their work. The World Bank states that AI technology enables developers to achieve sustainable development targets while enhancing public service delivery and enhancing decision-making capabilities for healthcare and agricultural and social welfare programs. The World Bank indicates that AI systems developed in the Global North will not function effectively in developing countries because they require specific local data and infrastructure and trained personnel. AI systems will create greater digital and economic disparities between groups when organizations fail to implement inclusion strategies .
Ethical and regulatory frameworks now hold essential value for AI because they were not originally considered. The UNESCO global recommendation establishes human rights and dignity and transparency and fairness and human oversight as essential principles which guide AI development and deployment. The established principles provide moral guidance to public institutions which want to harness AI advantages while preventing negative consequence 
In parallel, practical governance tools aim to help organisations operationalise responsible AI. The NIST AI Risk Management Framework provides a voluntary structure for identifying, assessing, and managing AI risks across the lifecycle, supporting more trustworthy deployment in real-world settings. This matters because the most impactful AI systems are increasingly those integrated into everyday decisions affecting people, safety, and access to opportunities .
Overall, AI is important because it is becoming a foundational capability for productivity, modern services, and national competitiveness. But its long-term benefits depend on responsible adoption, inclusive access, and serious attention to skills development and governance. The most realistic framing is not that AI will automatically transform everything for the better, but that it will amplify the quality of the systems, institutions, and decisions we build around it.
